# Instacart Reorder Prediction

This project investigates **what makes a customer repurchase a product** using the [Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis?select=aisles.csv).

The project serves as a portfolio piece and a personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of **consumer behaviour, feature engineering, and predictive modelling**, while also giving me the opportunity to practise with **SQL and Tableau**.

## Research Focus

- What features are most predictive of product reorders?
- How do user and product behaviours differ across departments?
- Can we build a robust model to predict whether a product will be reordered?
