2. Download the dataset (you may need to log into your Kaggle account)

3. Extract the contents and place all CSV files inside this `data/` folder:
   - `aisles.csv`
   - `departments.csv`
   - `order_products__prior.csv`
   - `order_products__train.csv`
   - `orders.csv`

4. Your folder structure should now look like:

instacart-reorder-prediction/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ aisles.csv
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ departments.csv
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ order_products__prior.csv
